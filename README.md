Docs are available at http://data-commons.github.io/prep-buddy
Or check out the [Scaladocs](http://data-commons.github.io/prep-buddy/scaladocs).

Our aim is to provide a set of algorithms for cleaning and transforming very large data sets, 
inspired by predecessors such as Open Refine, Pandas and Scikit-learn packages.
